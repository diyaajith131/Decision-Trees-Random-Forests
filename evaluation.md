# Model Evaluation

- **Decision Tree**
  - Accuracy: ~70-80% (dataset-dependent)
  - Overfits easily if depth not controlled.

- **Random Forest**
  - Accuracy: ~80-90% (dataset-dependent)
  - Cross-validation accuracy stable.
  - Less variance compared to Decision Tree.

- **Feature Importance**
  - Top predictors identified by Random Forest help interpret the model.
